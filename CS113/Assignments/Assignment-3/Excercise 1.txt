i.
while(condition statement){
}
While a condition is true run the code within the curly brackets over 
and over again.

int i = 1;
while(i<4){
	i+=2;
}

ii.
for(int var=0, var<num, i++){
}
While var is less than num run the code within the curly brackets over 
and over again. The increment of i makes sure that the loop will 
eventually exit the loop. Additionally i can be used in the loop. 

for(int var=0, var<4, i++){
	System.out.println(i);
}

iii.
if(condition statement){	
}
If the condition statement is true run the code within the curly brackets.

if(4>1){
	System.out.println("true");
}

iv.
int i[] = new int[arraysize];
The square brackets used in declaration makes the variable into an array.
The size of the array is denoted by the integer value of arraysize.

int i[] = new int[2];
i[0]=1;
i[1]=2;

v.
bool var = true;
bool is short for boolean. A boolean variable can either have the value of true
or false.
