#Notes

There are two types of planets:
   • Terrestrial Planets
   • Jovian

Gravitational Collapse of a Large Cloud:
   • The planets orbit the Sun in nearly the same plane because
     they formed in a flat disk

   • The direction in which the disk was spinning became the direction
     of the Sun’s rotation and the orbits of the planets.

Condensation:
   • Disks are hotest in the middle
   • Colder as you go outwards

Materials in the Solar Nebula:
   • Made of Hydrogen and Helium gas (98%)
   • Made of Rock ()
   • Made of Metals ()

The Terrestial Planets:
   • Mercury
   • Venus
   • Earth
   • Mars

Condensation and Accretion (InnerPlanets)
   • In the inner solar system, where only metal and rock could condense into solid particles, the planetesimals ended up being made up of metal and rock
   • These planetesimals grew rapidly at first, with some prabably-

Outer Planets:
   • Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune
      ◦ All these planets have rings

Jovian Planets:
   • Lots of condensation
   • Mass of planetesmials grew in mass and started having enough gravity to hold and capture gases
   • Disks of gas form around jovian planets
   • Cold planets

Moons and Rings:
   • Terrestial Planets have few moons
   • Jovian planets have large numbers of moons
      ◦ Jupiter moon ‘lo’ is volcanically active

Eugene M Shoemaker:
   • Discovered Crater in Arizona was made by a meteor
   • Killed in an automobile accident

Heavy Bombardment:
   • 4 bil years ago

ExtraSolar Planets:
   • What do they tell us about nebular theory
      ◦ Hot Jupiters
         ▸ Day is 3 something
      ◦ NASA’s Kepler mission

Radioactivity:
   • Carbon-12 which is in our bodies is stable
   • Some isotypes are unstable

Dating Rocks:
   • Done with potassium-40
   • Its decay helps in dating rocks

Age of Solar System:
   • Using rocks and dating them
   • meteorites date back to 4.55 bil years
   • Other planets are dated in millions

Geological Actvity:
   • Geological activity depends primarily on a world’s size:
      ◦ Because most geological activity is driven ...

Size, Internal Heat, & Interior Structure:
   • Volcanoes erupt when internal heat melts rock and releases gases that drive the molten rock upward
   • Earthqukes occur when heat-drven interal motions cause rock to slip or shift
   • All the Terrestrial worlds were wuite got when they were young ...

Surface Area to Volume Ratio:
   • The volume of an object stroes its heat
   • but heat can enter or leave the object only through its surface area

Interior of terrestial planets:
   • mantle
   • crust
   • /know_order

Convection:
    • hot material expands and rises
    • cold material contracts and falls

Magnetic Field:
   • Solar winds are sent to the north and south poles

Four Geological Processes:
   • Impact Cratering
   • Earthquakes
   • Erosion
      ◦ Reason we don’t see many craters
      ◦
   • Volcanoes

Atmosphere:
   • absorbs certain light like x-Ray/UV
   • Traps Heat
      ◦ Greenhouse Effect
         ▸ wator vapor is a greehouse gas
         ▸ carbon-dioxide is a greenhouse gas

Surface of the Moon:
   • Craters
   • highlands
   • maria
      ◦ low lying lava ~
   • Most craters are mor than 4 billion years old
      ◦ indicating heavy bombardment

Origin of Maria:
   • Decay of radioactive material built up interior heat to melt much of the moon’s mantle

Tidal Forces:
   • Forces relative to the sun
   • Forces relative to the earth
   • Spring Tide
   • Neap Tide

Russian Venera Lander:
   • only survived the 700k surface tempature for a few hours

Veus Surface:
   • Craters are rare and shallow
   • Ejecta stay close to crater due to dense atmosphere
   • Lots of volcanoes
      ◦ Pancake Domes
         ▸ 25km wide and 750m high
   • Does Venus have Active Volcanoes?
      ◦ Spikes of SO2 found
   • Atmosphere
      ◦ toxic and made up of CO2 and N2
   • Rotation
      ◦ Venus spins backward

Mars:
   • Olympus Mons Volcano
      ◦ 4 volcanoes on mars
   • There are no plate motions on mars
      ◦ volcanoes grew big
   • Lota Dust
   • Days are similar
   • Seasons are more pronounced
      ◦ Hotter Summers
      ◦ Colder winters
   • Solar Polar Cap
   • Evidence for water
      ◦ Victoria Crater
      ◦ Mineral Evidence
   • Change in Magnetic Field
      ◦ mars’s interior cooled until the core convection stopped
         ▸ weakened magnetic field
      ◦ Solar wind blew away atmospheric gas
   • Why is Mars red?
      ◦ lacks ultraviolet-absorbing gases
      ◦ chemicals reations with rocksmay have absorbed oxygen and rusted the planet
      ◦ lost water to space

Composition of Jovian Planets:
   • Similar to composition to the sun
   • composed of hydrogen compounds
   • Nebular Theory
      ◦ Planets formed beyond the frost line
      ◦ Beause of ice planetesimals grew large increasing mass
      ◦ Jupiter and Saturn captured so much hydrogen and helium gas most of their composition became gas
         ▸ Uranous and Neptune did not capture as much gas
   • Cloudy atmosphere hotter closer to the surface
   •Saturn
      ◦ Cassini gap is the space between Saturn and its rings
      ◦ Has many rings
         ▸ each ring is individually oribit Saturn

Resonance:
   • Reason why gaps in Saturn’s rings occur
   • Orbital Resonance
      ◦ periodic nudges reinforcing a gap between rings
